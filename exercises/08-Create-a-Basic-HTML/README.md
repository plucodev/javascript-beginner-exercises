# `08` Create a basic HTML

Let's continue using string concatenation to generate HTML...




## üìù Instructions:

1. The code on the left contains 8 constants with different string values, please use
the constants and concatenate them together to set the value of the variable **htmlDocument**
a new string that has the content of a typical HTML document (with the HTML tags in the
right order).

Then, print the value of htmlDocument on the console.

The output should look like this:

```js

<html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>
```
