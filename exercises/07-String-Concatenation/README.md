# `07` String Concatenation

One of Javascript's main objectives is to generate HTML code; concatenation comes in handy
because you can create and add to existing HTML strings. To concatenate strings, we use
the + (plus) operator, for example:

```Javascript
var one = 'a';
var two = 'b';
console.log(one+two); //this will print 'ab' on the console.
```

Constants are super useful because some times, as a developer, you want to make sure parts of your data are read-only.


## 📝 Instructions:

1. Set the values for myVar1 and myVar2 so the code prints 'Hello World' in the console.
