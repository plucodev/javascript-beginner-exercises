## üìù Instructions:
1. Please write an algorithm to print the exact same lyrics.

let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, words of wisdom, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, there will be an answer, let it be

## üí° Hint:

- At the end of the song, the lyrics change because is only one bottle (singular instead of plural).
- Read the last lyrics and you will see how the last line changes to "go to the store and by some more".

The result should be something like this:

```sh
99 bottles of milk on the wall, 99 bottles of milk.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of milk on the wall.

98 bottles of milk on the wall, 98 bottles of milk.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of milk on the wall.
...
...
1 bottle of milk on the wall, 1 bottle of milk.
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of milk on the wall.

No more bottles of milk on the wall, no more bottles of milk.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of milk on the wall.
```
