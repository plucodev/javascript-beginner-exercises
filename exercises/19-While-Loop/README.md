# `19` While Loop

This code is broken, it produces an infinite loop. Replit handles the infinite loop, for now.

Fix the problem, to print from 100 - 0. And return 0.

IMPORTANT: there's a Classroom Exercise dedicated to Arrays, we encourage you to go and finish those after this first Array exercise. (And then, come back).
