# `11` Create a New Function

As you know, functions are a useful block of code that you can re-use as many times
as you need or want. In the last exercise, you had a function that received two parameters (two inputs) and returned the sum of those. Like this:

```js
function addNumbers(a, b){
  return a + b;
}

```

But Javascript comes with a bunch of "pre defined" functions that you can use, for example:

```js
Math.random();
}

```

You can use the Math.random() function to get a random decimal number between 0 and 1, every
time you call that function it will return another random decimal number between 0 and 1.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please now create a function called **generateRandom** that generates a random number
between 0 and 9 every time it is called.

## 💡 Hint:

One possible solution involves using two predefined functions: the **Math.random** and **Math.floor** functions.
