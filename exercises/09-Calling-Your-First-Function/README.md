# `09` Calling Your First Function

Functions are amazing because of many things, but mainly because you can encapsulate your code
in pieces and re-use those pieces several times without having to type all that code again.

IMPORTANT: there's a Replit Classroom dedicated to Functions, we encourage you to go and finish
those after this first Function exercise. (And then, come back).




## üìù Instructions:

1. The function isOdd is defined at the beginning of the code, please call that function passing
it the number 45345 and print the result on the console.
